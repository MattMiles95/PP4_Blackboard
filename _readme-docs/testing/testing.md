## Validators

### HTML

Due to the use of Django template tags causing false errors, I have carried out my HTML validation tests by navigating to each page of my site and pressing 'ctrl + U' (view page source). I then copied and pasted this code into the 'direct input' field of the W3 Nu Html Checker.

The below table shows the number of warnings and errors indicated for each page. I only tested pages I have built; I have not tested any default Django templates (such as those included with Django allauth).

| **Page** | **Warnings** | **Errors**|
| --- | --- |
| Homepage | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Eng) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Hist) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Psych) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Detail | Multiple* | *Multiple |
| Homework Dashboard | 0 | 0 |
| Homework Submission | 0 | 0 |

*The HTML content generated by Django Summernote caused multiple false validation errors. Notwithstanding this content, no errors were detected.
