## Validators

### HTML

<details>
<summary> HTML Validation - W3C </summary>

![Screenshot of HTML Validation from W3C](/_readme-docs/images/validator_html.png)
</details>
<br>

Due to the use of Django template tags causing false errors, I have carried out my HTML validation tests by navigating to each page of my site and pressing 'ctrl + U' (view page source). I then copied and pasted this code into the 'direct input' field of the W3C Nu Html Checker.

The below table shows the number of warnings and errors indicated for each page. I only tested pages I have built; I have not tested any default Django templates (such as those included with Django allauth).

| **Page** | **Errors** | **Warnings**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Eng) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Hist) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Psych) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Detail | Multiple* | Multiple* |
| Homework Dashboard | 0 | 0 |
| Homework Submission | 0 | 0 |

*The HTML content generated by Django Summernote caused multiple false validation errors and warnings. Notwithstanding this content, no errors or warnings were detected.

### CSS

<details>
<summary> CSS Validation - W3C </summary>

![Screenshot of HTML Validation from W3C](/_readme-docs/images/validator_css.png)
</details>
<br>

Due to Bootstrap causing false warnings, I tested my CSS by direct input into W3C's CSS Validation Service.

CSS passed validation with 0 errors and 1 warning. This warning was simply advising that imported files were not checked by the validator's direct input service (referring to the inported Google Fonts).

## Lighthouse Testing

| **Page** | **Performance** | **Accessibility**| **Best Practices** | **SEO** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage (Authenticated) | 98 | 98 | 100 | 90 |
| Homepage (Not Authenticated) | 98 | 98 | 100 | 90 |
| Lesson Feed (Eng) | 95 | 95 | 100 | 91 |
| Lesson Feed (Hist) | 95 | 95 | 100 | 91 |
| Lesson Feed (Psych) | 100 | 100 | 100 | 91 |
| Lesson Detail | 100 | 91 | 100 | 82 |
| Homework Dashboard | 98 | 98 | 100 | 90 |
| Homework Submission | 99 | 90 | 100 | 90 |
| Login | 98 | 95 | 100 | 90 |
| Logout | 98 | 94 | 100 | 90 |
| Account Registration | 98 | 95 | 100 | 90 |

The only page to have any of the test categories score below 90 is 'lesson_detail.html'. This is due to 4 anchor tags not having crawlable links. These are the two anchor tags for each the 'report' button and the 'delete' button. The reason these anchor tags don't have crawlable links is because they are intentionally written with placeholder text (href="javascript:void(0)">), as the JavaScript that enables the functionality of these buttons does so by replacing the href with 'delete/report_comment/${commentId}' when clicked.

### Bug Fixes

Throughout the development of my project, I carried out the following bug fixes:

| Feature | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Database | Updating models | Couldn't reconcile changes made | Error caused by deleting previous migration files, ultimately corrupting the database. A new database was created to replace the corrupted database |
| Cloudinary Security | Secure responses received from Cloudinary | HTTP responses instead of HTTPS, causing unsecure responses | Updated settings.py to configure secure responses from Cloudinary |
| Comment Report Button | Reported comment's status changes from 'approved' to 'reported' | 500 error | Bug caused by the initial report button having the same id as the report button in the confirmation modal, causing a JavaScript error. ID changed to differentiate between buttons |
| Comment Edit Button | Clicking 'submit' button submits changes to comment | 500 error | ID 'submitButton' had been changed due to conflicting CSS, which caused a bug with the JavaScript. Html and JS updated with new ID |
| Homework Submission Lesson Menu | Lesson dropdown menu only contains lessons associated with the selected subject | Menu empty | Created Homework Dashboard as a means for the subject to be selected prior to reaching the submission page, allowing for the subject.id to be correctly assigned prior to accessing the submission form |
| Homepage subject buttons | Clicking a button directs the User to the respective lesson feed | No response | href's had been left as '#'s. Updated with correct url links |

I am not aware of any further bugs effecting this project.
