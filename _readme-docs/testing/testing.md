The below table shows the number of warnings and errors indicated for each page. I only tested pages I have built; I have not tested any default Django templates (such as those included with Django allauth).

| **Page** | **Errors** | **Warnings**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Eng) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Hist) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Feed (Psych) | 0 | 0 |
| Lesson Detail | Multiple* | Multiple* |
| Homework Dashboard | 0 | 0 |
| Homework Submission | 0 | 0 |
